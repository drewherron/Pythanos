# PyThanos

Keep your projects perfectly balanced by randomly deleting half of the files.

- Running this program will delete half of all files in the current directory and subdirectories.
- I generally do not recommend using this at all.
- If you **do** use this, I'm not responsible for your megalomaniacal actions.
